# Guide to Build Homebrew from Dockerfile

**Project Description:**

The **Homebrew Docker Guide** provides a comprehensive guide and a `Dockerfile` to build and use Homebrew within a Docker environment. It enables users to create a Docker image with Homebrew, allowing them to run Homebrew commands in an isolated container.

## Features

- Step-by-step instructions to set up Homebrew in Docker.
- A ready-to-use `Dockerfile` for building a Docker image with Homebrew.
- Commands to manage Docker containers (start, stop, attach, etc.).
- Support for installing Homebrew packages in a secure environment.

This project is perfect for developers who want to use Homebrew without installing it directly on their host system.This guide provides detailed steps to build and use Homebrew from a Dockerfile. Follow these instructions to create a Docker image that includes Homebrew and to run Homebrew commands inside a Docker container.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Docker: [Download and install Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Creating the Dockerfile

Create a file named `Dockerfile` in your project directory and add the following content to it:

```dockerfile
ARG version=24.10
# version is passed through by Docker.
# shellcheck disable=SC2154
FROM ubuntu:"${version}"
ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# Deterministic UID (first user). Helps with docker build cache
ENV USER_ID=1000
# Delete the default ubuntu user & group UID=1000 GID=1000 in Ubuntu 23.04+
# that conflicts with the linuxbrew user
RUN touch /var/mail/ubuntu && chown ubuntu /var/mail/ubuntu && userdel -r ubuntu; true

# We don't want to manually pin versions, happy to use whatever
# Ubuntu thinks is best.
# hadolint ignore=DL3008

# `gh` installation taken from https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md#debian-ubuntu-linux-raspberry-pi-os-apt
# /etc/lsb-release is checked inside the container and sets DISTRIB_RELEASE.
# We need `[` instead of `[[` because the shell is `/bin/sh`.
# shellcheck disable=SC1091,SC2154,SC2292

```

## Building the Docker Image

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `Dockerfile`. Run the following command to build the Docker image:

```sh
docker build -t homebrew:latest .
```

This command will create a Docker image named `homebrew` with the tag `latest`.

## Running a Container from the Image

Once the image is built, you can run a container from it using the following command:

```sh
docker run -it homebrew:latest
```

This command starts a new container in interactive mode and opens a bash shell.

## Using Homebrew in the Container

Inside the running container, you can use Homebrew commands as usual. Here are some examples:

- **Check Homebrew version:**

  ```sh
  brew --version
  ```

- **Update Homebrew and installed formulae:**

  ```sh
  brew update
  brew upgrade
  ```

- **Install a package with Homebrew:**

  ```sh
  brew install wget
  ```

## Detaching and Reattaching to the Container

To detach from the running container without stopping it, use the following key combination:

- **CTRL + P, then CTRL + Q** or ```exit```

To list running containers and find the container ID or name:

```sh
docker ps
```

To reattach to the running container:

```sh
docker attach <container_id_or_name>
```

## Stopping and Restarting the Container

To stop the running container:

```sh
docker ps -as | grep <search_term> | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker stop
```

Replace `<search_term>` with a relevant term to filter the container you wish to stop.

To restart the stopped container:

```sh
docker start <container_id_or_name>
```

To reattach to the restarted container:

```sh
docker attach <container_id_or_name>
```

## Using `docker exec` to Access a Running Container

If you need to execute commands inside a running container without attaching to it, you can use the `docker exec` command. First, list the running containers:

```sh
docker ps -as | grep <search_term> | awk '{print $1}'
```

Replace `<search_term>` with a relevant term to filter the container you wish to access.

Then, use the container ID to run a command inside the container:

```sh
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash
```

## Additional Resources

For more information on Docker and Homebrew, refer to the following resources:

- [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)
- [Homebrew Documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/)

By following this guide, you should be able to build and use Homebrew from a Dockerfile effectively. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to refer to the official documentation or seek assistance from the community.
